# Chess Game in Unity 🧩♟️
This is my first bigger project in C# and in Unity, it's a chess application. It features human vs human playmode, the program follows all of the chess rules that includes special moves like promotion or castling. 

# Features ✨
Full Chess Mechanics: Support for all chess rules, including en passant, castling, and pawn promotion.
Sound Effects: Immersive audio feedback for moves and captures.

# Project Structure 📂
Scripts/: Contains logic for chess rules, board state, and piece movement. \
Assets/: Includes sprites, animations, and audio assets. \
Scenes/: Unity scenes for menu and gameplay. \
Build/: Folder with game ready to launch!

# Installation ⚙️
If you want to just play all you need to do is download Build folder and use 'Chess Unity.exe'. \
The game can be restarted by pressing the Space key once the game finishes.

# Roadmap 🗺️
 I intend to create simple AI for human vs computer gamemode.
